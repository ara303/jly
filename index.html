        <h2>Meet Joe</h2>
        <p>Greetings from me, Joe Bell. Thanks for visiting my website. My vinyasa flow classes are inspired by all the learnings and all of the teachers I have met along the way.</p>
        <p>Classes are fun, dynamic, suitable for all levels and understanding of all your needs.  There is chanting, pranayama, hands on adjustments and time to release and let go.</p>
        <p>Yoga is for <em>everyone</em> and <em>everybody</em> - regardless of your age, gender and physical limitations. It is a practice without judgement or competition.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Joe Bell and  I am a yoga teacher and doula. The fire was lit by my Great Uncle Jack over 30 years ago, he was dedicated, focused and strong.</p>
        <p>I vowed to travel in his footsteps and while travelling for many years I always carried a tatty manual or two in my back pack. Sunset was my time to practice; thanking the sun for its companionship during the day, thanking my body for all it did for me and to stretch and release after carrying a heavy load.</p>
        <p>I started teaching over a decade ago and have never looked back.Yoga has helped me to build and create a life long love affair with moving, breathing, exploring and I am in constant awe of how amazing a body can be. Each and every student that comes my way I cherish teaching and learn so much from them.</p>
        <p>The positives and negatives in all of us are reflections of all within us.  My journey of studying and practice is far from completed from which I get my inspiration. And they all get woven into the web I share, for example, through meditation, books, films and courses.  But most importantly from all my many dear teachers.</p>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <img src="img/forkids.jpg" alt="Classes for kids" />
        <h3>For Kids</h3>
        <p>A fantastic way to learn yoga and its benefits through play and stories.  Helping the light inside a child to shine bright.</p>
        <p>These classes are an exceptional way to develop better attention and concentration. Teaching life long tools to build lasting acceptance of themselves and others.  And most importantly to take time out from all the stresses of being a young child theses day!</p>
        <p>No tests, no technology, lots of smiles and laughter.  I currently teach in Kineton after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays after school in Leamington Spa. Classes stop during school breaks.  Family workshop days run through school holidays.</p>
        <img src="img/forteens.jpg" alt="Classes to suit teenagers" />
        <h3>For Teens</h3>
        <p>Yoga to <em>build mental health</em> among young people. While many young people are well, vibrant and have a strong voice in the world today, yoga supports and helps those who do not, through simple tools that alleviate stress, relieve trauma and empower young people.</p>
        <p>Exploring ways to communicate positively can help to ground life long tools to find compassion and empathy in all situations throughout our existence.</p>
        <img src="img/pregnancyyoga.jpg" alt="Yoga for pregnancy" />
        <h3>Pregnancy Yoga</h3>
        <h4>A perfect time to take time away from time.</h4>
        <p>Yoga whilst pregnant is really beneficial, specially adapting poses to promote healthy body systems during this important time in a woman’s life.</p>
        <p>You will explore breathing techniques to help relax and release stress and to find tools to help you during labour.</p>
        <p>I currently teach pregnancy yoga as a private class in your home. Classes do not have to just be one-on-one. You're welcome to have friends or family join you.</p>
        <h3>Going private</h3>
        <img src="img/privateyoga.jpg" alt="Private yoga" />
        <h4>Tailoring postures, pranayama and meditation into your time.</h4>
        <p>Going private is sometimes a special opportunity to suit a class just to your individual needs, daily life or circumstances.</p>
        <p>These classes are opportunities to work either by yourself or with a friend or partner to find what you want out of the class.</p>
        <img src="img/birthprep.jpg" alt="Birth preparation and Doula" />
        <h3>Birth Preparation & Doula</h3>
        <p>​As well as a yoga teacher I am a doula.</p>
        <p>A doula is a birth companion and post-birth supporter. Giving non-medical support to women and families pre, during and post birth.  If you are looking for someone to support and nurture you individually during your birth, please do get in touch.</p>
        <p><strong>Birth Preparation Workshops For Couples</strong></p>
        <p>These workshops are informative and fun ways to approach labour, giving time to release any fears surrounding the birth of your baby.  These sessions help to undertake the birth of your child in a positive and open way.</p>
        <img src="img/parties.jpg" alt="Yoga for parties" />
        <h3>Parties</h3>
        <p>Yoga parties are a great way to keep the kids amused during a party. Fun games, creative activities and time for cake and treats as well!</p>
        <p>​If you would love a yoga party for your child please do get in touch for prices and availability.</p>
        <p><strong>Family Day</strong></p>
        <p>Family day sessions are fun bonding experiences for families, creating enjoyable and beneficial experiences together.</p>
        <p>These are workshops of 2 hours with a time for a break to snack and toilet in between.</p>
        <p>Working together to support families to bring a deeper connection and a better sense of calm and love into your home and lives.</p>
        <p>This practice can be enjoyed with your partner, friend, baby, young child, pre-teen or grandparent.</p>
        <p><strong>Brownies & Rainbows</strong></p>
        <p>I am often asked to go along and run sessions for the health weeks at Brownies and Rainbows.</p>
        <p>This is a fun way to introduce the elements of breathing relaxation but all after playing great games developing coordination, cooperation and concentration.</p>
        <p>It would be fantastic to go into Cubs, Beavers and Scouts groups too! If you would like your pack or troop to have some yoga fun please do get in touch.</p>
        <p>Please get in touch with any questions you may have about your particular needs and for prices and availability.</p>

                <p>I really enjoy Jo's aqua yoga class. Not only does she make it good fun and is a great teacher, but I can feel how much I have benefited in my core stability and general fitness, having had two operations on my right hip. Thank you Jo - we all love you! (You don't have to put that in, but it is true!)</p>

                <p>I have been a client of Joe’s now for over a year and have found she has this wonderful ability to relax me and increase my agility.  Her knowledge, and her enthusiasm, along with her genuine empathy for my condition, makes her sessions something that I really look forward to.  In some sessions, having been extremely stiff and uncomfortable at the start, have resulted in me falling asleep (hope I didn’t snore!)</p>

                <p>The reason I love yoga is because it is calming and is great body exercise. The amazing games that come with it are great, like Janga and Corners. You’ve turned a normal hall into a Yoga sensation and I love it!</p>

                <p>I have been having 1-to-1 yoga sessions with Joe for 2 years now. I am a competitive international wheelchair racer and I have been very pleased at how she has managed to adapt yoga to suit my situation and physical limitations.  I have noticed improvments in my body symmetry, flexibility and core strength and it has made me much more aware of my body positioning, alignment and areas of weakness I need to work on.  I feel this has been a great benefit to me as an athlete and these improvements have really assisted me in my sport as well as in daily life.  Joe is great as a teacher and easy to work with.  I would recommend her to anyone whether you are just starting out in yoga, as I was, or have been practicing it for years.</p>

                <p>Joe is an inspiring teacher making every class different, offering different approaches to poses for different abilities, encouraging and nurturing her students to be the best they can.  She offers various styles of yoga e.g. mandalas, underpins practice with clarification and the purpose of the poses.  Her classes encourage a thoughtful approach but are always fun.  Leaving her class I feel physically lighter and mentally lifted. I’m glad she has been around over the past two years to help me with my journey. Joe has bought balance both physically and mentally into my life by attending her class.</p>
